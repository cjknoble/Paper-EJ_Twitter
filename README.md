# Paper-EJ_Twitter
These scripts are used for investigating the relationships between Tweets and environmental justice factors in northern NJ.
Environmental justice terms were selected by drawing out the most frequently used terms from research abstracts referring to environmental justice. 
Tweets were pulled from the Twitter API and cleaned using a tokenizing approach. 
A spatial autoregression model was used to analyze the final dataset following analysis in GIS.
